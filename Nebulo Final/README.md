# 🚀 Nebulo V2.0 - The Ultimate iOS IPTV Experience

**Nebulo V2.0** is here! This is a complete rewrite and a massive leap forward, bringing desktop-class features to your iPhone and iPad. With a stunning glassmorphism UI, Multi-View support, and a dedicated Sports Center, Nebulo defines how IPTV should look and feel on iOS.
